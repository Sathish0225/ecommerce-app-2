# START - Testing Protocol - DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE THIS SECTION

## This section contains critical testing instructions for both agents (BOTH main_agent and testing_agent MUST preserve this entire block)

## Communication Protocol

- If `testing_agent` is available, main_agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
- The file `test_result.md` contains the complete testing state and history.
- This file is the primary means of communication between agents.
- The testing data must be entered in YAML format, using the structure below:

## backend

- task: "Task name"
  implemented: true
  working: true  # or false or "NA"
  file: "file_path.py"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history
  - working: true  # or false or "NA"
    agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
    comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend

- task: "Task name"
  implemented: true
  working: true  # or false or "NA"
  file: "file_path.js"
  stuck_count: 0
  priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
  needs_retesting: false
  status_history
  - working: true  # or false or "NA"
    agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
    comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## metadata

  created_by: "main_agent"
  version: "1.0"
  test_sequence: 0
  run_ui: false

## test_plan

current_focus

- "Task name 1"
- "Task name 2"
stuck_tasks
- "Task name with persistent issues"
test_all: false
test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"

## agent_communication

- agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
message: "Communication message between agents"

## Protocol Guidelines for Main Agent

1.Update `test_result.md` before calling the testing agent

- Update `status_history` with implementation details
- Set `needs_retesting: true` for tasks that need testing
- Update the `test_plan` to indicate what needs focus
- Add a message to `agent_communication` with your changes

2.Incorporate user feedback

- Update `status_history` with user-reported issues
- Change `working` status accordingly
- If recurring issues arise, increase `stuck_count`

3.Track stuck tasks

- Monitor tasks with a high `stuck_count`
- Use `stuck_tasks` list in `test_plan` for persistent problems
- Donâ€™t reset `stuck_count` unless confirmed by testing agent

4.Provide full context to testing agent

- Specify tasks needing testing (see `test_plan`)
- Include any configuration/authentication details
- Mention edge cases or known issues

5.Always update `test_result.md` before invoking testing agent
